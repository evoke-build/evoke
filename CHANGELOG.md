## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-21

The first release: the CLI, the package manager and the SDK.

- `evoke "<sentence>"` decides among the installed reflexes and runs, confirms, asks or abstains; a REPL, a pipe
  and `--json` for scripts.
- `add`, `remove`, `update`, `sync` and `trust`: reflexes fetched from git at a tag, pinned by content in
  `evoke.lock`.
- `teach`, overlays, vocabularies and `config`: wording tuned in files you own, never touched by an update.
- `new`, `check` and `test`: a reflex written, typed and tested in ten minutes.
- `@evoke-build/evoke`: the same decisions inside a Node application, over the same core as WebAssembly.
- `evoke-build/reflexes`: thirteen reflexes for what a Mac does at a word.
